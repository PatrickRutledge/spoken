USFM ingestion notes - Scholarly Formatting Standards
- **Paragraph Structure**: We strictly honor USFM paragraph markers (\p, \m) to preserve biblical manuscript traditions
  - Paragraph breaks may occur mid-sentence to maintain theological thought units
  - Each paragraph represents a complete literary or thematic unit as determined by biblical scholars
  - This matches the formatting found in academic study Bibles and scholarly editions
- **Text Processing**: 
  - Remove chapter/verse numbers and editorial headings
  - Paragraphs: justified, first-line indent, one blank line spacing
  - Poetry: preserve USFM poetry markers (\q, \q1, \q2) with appropriate indentation
  - Small caps for the divine name (e.g., LORD)
  - Capitalize pronouns for Deity (He, Him, His, etc.) in English
  - Smart quotes and em-dash normalization
- **Why Mid-Sentence Breaks**: USFM preserves Hebrew and Greek manuscript structure where thematic shifts, speakers, or narrative actions create natural divisions that don't always align with English sentence structure

Attribution
- Provide a short distribution/attribution line per translation (displayed in HTML/PDF footer).

Catalog manifest
- See docs/catalog-manifest.md for the JSON schema used by the download catalog.

Do we commit the versions/ folder?
- Public-domain development copies can be kept locally. Avoid committing large binary zip files to keep the repo light.
- Preferred: Host in release assets or a CDN/Git LFS; include only sample/small test packs in the repo.
